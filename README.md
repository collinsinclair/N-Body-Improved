# N-Body-Improved

by Collin Sinclair

----------
Welcome to my new-and-improved N-Body Simulation application! This command line-based app will walk you through selecting a customizing an N-body simulation of any of the following varieties:
- Sun-Earth System
- Sun-Earth-Moon System
- Kepler-16A Circumbinary Planet System
- Random Cube of Bodies
- Uniform Cube of Bodies
- Pythagorean System (3-4-5 triangle)
- Figure 8
- Planetesimal Disk
- Tiny Star Cluster

Once the user provides input for all customizable values, the program will generate, save, and display an animation of the system.

## Usage
[Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your device and navigate to its directory. First, to ensure that the simulation has all of the resources needed to run, use `pip install requirements.txt` or equivalent (e.g. `conda install requirements.txt`). Then rnu `python3 main.py` and have fun!
