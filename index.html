        <h1>N-Body Simulation</h1>
        <p>Imagine a whole bunch of stuff (preferably coalesced into bodies like stars or planets) out there in space.
            Anywhere, anytime. Just, <em>imagine</em>. What are those things doing? Are they still? Spinning? Moving
            towards or away from one another? If only we could look at it for ourselves... But wait, <strong>we
                can!</strong> - and this tool (or toy?) can help.</p>
        <p>This <em>N-Body Simulation</em> started its life as my final project for CU Boulder's ASTR 2600: Introduction
            to Scientific Programming, but back then I didn't know what I was doing or how to do it, at least as far as
            useful programs go. So I decided to give that old IPython notebook a facelift and turn it into something
            others could experience and (hopefully) learn from.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Ugh. If any part of this program will stop people from enjoying it, it's the installation. Hopefully <a
                href="https://github.com/collinsinclair/N-Body-Improved/issues/16">someday in the future,</a> this will
            exist as an app instead of a series of scripts and modules that exist separately. For now, provided you have
            access to a Unix-like command line, you can run <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>. You'll also
            have to <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">install ffmpeg,</a> a multimedia framework.</p>
        <p>Once you have everything installed, you can <em>finally</em> run the program with
            <code>python3 main.py</code>. This will start the command line interface (or CLI, once you get to know it
            better).
        </p>

        <h2>Use</h2>
        You will first be greeted by some text introducing you to the program.
        <video src="media/intro.mov" loop autoplay>Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.</video>
        <p>After you get through all that info (still trying to decide if it's worth it to keep all that there...) you
            are taken to the meat of the app: a menu detailing the available systems for you to screw around with.</p>

        <h2>Simulations</h2>
        <h3>Sun-Earth</h3>
        <p>Here is the first and most basic of the simulations: it's just the Sun and the Earth! And because I haven't
            coded in any sort of friction or otherwise resistive forces, nothing is changing! There is one issue though
            - the Sun should be the same color (based on distance from (0,0,0)) in the scatter plots and the kinetic
            energy line plot, but it isn't! <a href="https://github.com/collinsinclair/N-Body-Improved/issues/18">Feel
                free to fix it if you know how ;)</a></p>

        <h3>Sun-Earth-Moon</h3>
        <p>You really can't even tell the Moon is there, and that's because it's inside the Earth. No, really! The dots
            are scaled by mass, but I set an absolute minimum size so that all particle/bodies would be visible from the
            outset. This fact, combined with the (literal) astronomical scales in the Sun-Earth-Moon system put the Moon
            inside of the Earth in the plot.</p>

        <h3>Kepler-16</h3>
        <p>From Wikipedia, "Kepler-16 is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipsing_binary">eclipsing binary
                star</a> system in the constellation of Cygnus that was targeted by the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)">Kepler spacecraft</a>. Both stars are smaller
            than the Sun; the primary, Kepler-16A, is a K-type <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence">main-sequence</a> star and the secondary, Kepler-16B,
            is an M-type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf">red dwarf.</a> They are separated by 0.22 AU,
            and complete an orbit around a common center of mass every 41 days."</p>
        <p>I think the interesting feature illustrated by this simulation is that all three bodies seem to be orbiting
            <em>nothing</em>! Of course, this is not the case - they are orbiting the <em>barycenter</em>, the center of
            mass of the three bodies. Specifically, notice the planet (small yellow outer dot) that is orbiting in a
            perfect circle around this point - almost un-perturbed by the stars! Its kinetic energy is staying constant
            (and low, relative to the stars, due to its extremely small mass) throughout this orbit.
        </p>
        <p>FInally, notice that the stars are in a pattern of falling towards each other and then falling past each
            other, speeding them up and slowing them down together. This is illustrated in the kinetic energy plot as
            both oscillate simultaneously.</p>
