        <h1>N-Body Simulation</h1>
        <p>Imagine a whole bunch of stuff (preferably coalesced into bodies like stars or planets) out there in space.
            Anywhere, anytime. Just, <em>imagine</em>. What are those things doing? Are they still? Spinning? Moving
            towards or away from one another? If only we could look at it for ourselves... But wait, <strong>we
                can!</strong> - and this tool (or toy?) can help.</p>
        <p>This <em>N-Body Simulation</em> started its life as my final project for CU Boulder's ASTR 2600: Introduction
            to Scientific Programming, but back then I didn't know what I was doing or how to do it, at least as far as
            useful programs go. So I decided to give that old IPython notebook a facelift and turn it into something
            others could experience and (hopefully) learn from.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Ugh. If any part of this program will stop people from enjoying it, it's the installation. Hopefully <a
                href="https://github.com/collinsinclair/N-Body-Improved/issues/16">someday in the future,</a> this will
            exist as an app instead of a series of scripts and modules that exist separately. For now, provided you have
            access to a Unix-like command line, you can run <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>. You'll also
            have to <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">install ffmpeg,</a> a multimedia framework.</p>
        <p>Once you have everything installed, you can <em>finally</em> run the program with
            <code>python3 main.py</code>. This will start the command line interface (or CLI, once you get to know it
            better).
        </p>

        <h2>Use</h2>
        You will first be greeted by some text introducing you to the program.
        <video src="media/intro.mov" loop autoplay>Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.</video>
        <p>After you get through all that info (still trying to decide if it's worth it to keep all that there...) you
            are taken to the meat of the app: a menu detailing the available systems for you to screw around with.</p>

        <h2>Simulations</h2>
        <h3>Sun-Earth</h3>
        <p>Here is the first and most basic of the simulations: it's just the Sun and the Earth! And because I haven't
            coded in any sort of friction or otherwise resistive forces, nothing is changing! There is one issue though
            - the Sun should be the same color (based on distance from (0,0,0)) in the scatter plots and the kinetic
            energy line plot, but it isn't! <a href="https://github.com/collinsinclair/N-Body-Improved/issues/18">Feel
                free to fix it if you know how ;)</a></p>

        <h3>Sun-Earth-Moon</h3>
        <p>You really can't even tell the Moon is there, and that's because it's inside the Earth. No, really! The dots
            are scaled by mass, but I set an absolute minimum size so that all particle/bodies would be visible from the
            outset. This fact, combined with the (literal) astronomical scales in the Sun-Earth-Moon system put the Moon
            inside of the Earth in the plot.</p>

        <h3>Kepler-16</h3>
        <p>From Wikipedia, "Kepler-16 is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipsing_binary">eclipsing binary
                star</a> system in the constellation of Cygnus that was targeted by the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)">Kepler spacecraft</a>. Both stars are smaller
            than the Sun; the primary, Kepler-16A, is a K-type <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence">main-sequence</a> star and the secondary, Kepler-16B,
            is an M-type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf">red dwarf.</a> They are separated by 0.22 AU,
            and complete an orbit around a common center of mass every 41 days."</p>
        <p>I think the interesting feature illustrated by this simulation is that all three bodies seem to be orbiting
            <em>nothing</em>! Of course, this is not the case - they are orbiting the <em>barycenter</em>, the center of
            mass of the three bodies. Specifically, notice the planet (small yellow outer dot) that is orbiting in a
            perfect circle around this point - almost un-perturbed by the stars! Its kinetic energy is staying constant
            (and low, relative to the stars, due to its extremely small mass) throughout this orbit.
        </p>
        <p>FInally, notice that the stars are in a pattern of falling towards each other and then falling past each
            other, speeding them up and slowing them down together. This is illustrated in the kinetic energy plot as
            both oscillate simultaneously.</p>

        <h3>Random Cube of Bodies</h3>
        <p>This simulation is the first example of things that can go terribly wrong in numerical computation. Almost
            immediately, two of the bodies in the cube collide (more or less, i.e., they fling past each other), sending
            them off into space at exceptionally high velocities. This isn't entirely unphysical, but what we're seeing
            here is the force of gravity going through the roof (remember, gravitation force is inversely proportional
            the the square of separation - this means that when objects get very close, gravity gets very large). The
            "course" timestep of the simulation (0.5 days) allowed for the close approach and slingshot phenomenon, but
            in the next step the objects were already so far separated that they weren't going to be slowed down by
            gravity (again, at large distances gravity gets very small). This is what resulted in the apparent creation
            of energy (and lots of it), as well as the system becoming almost unobservable as those two bodies get
            further and further away from the center of the system.</p>
        <p>I think this is a good time to acknowledge the work of a close friend of mine who has contributed some
            amazing work to this project. First, he coded the "perspective" effect where the particles get smaller as
            the bounds increase to keep everything in frame - a much better visualization than I initially had. Also, he
            wrote a version of the calculations that use <em>adaptive time steps</em>, a way to reduce these
            non-physical phenomena. I haven't included this improvement quite yet, as there are still some kinks to iron
            out. Either way, his work has helped to elevate this project to the next level, and I am thankful that he
            has decided to lend me some of his genius on all of this.</p>

        <h3>Uniform Cube of Bodies</h3>
        <p>Here we see another slingshot phenomenon, something that could be fixed by an adaptive time step process as
            mentioned above, or by simply using smaller constant time steps. In the video below, I used a time step of
            0.5 days.</p>
        <video src="media/UniformCube_2021-11-13-01-53-14.mp4" loop autoplay controls></video>
        <p>Now let's use a finer time step and see how the result change (and since this system isn't randomly
            generated, the results are a true testament to the power - and shortcomings - of numerical integration).</p>

        <h3>Pythagorean System</h3>
        <p>I absolutely love how this one shows the slingshotting with more-or-less correct "deceleration" afterwards.
            The simulation starts with all three particles accelerating towards each other, then we see the two close
            encounters fling the particles off into space, and finally we see everything get pulled back
            gravitationally, slowing everything down appropriately. It almost appears as if the particles will fall back
            towards each other, but alas. They have successfully <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity">escaped</a> each other's gravity. Beautiful!</p>

        <h3>Figure 8</h3>
        <p>A classic example of N-body choreography, the obscure art of finding perfectly periodic N-body solutions.</p>

        <h3>Planetesimal Disk</h3>
        <p>Everyone's favorite. There are lots of things to talk about here! First, I used the default parameters to
            simulate a planetesimal disk with 30 bodies over the course of a year (with a timestep of 0.5 days). The
            particles have a small but noticeable z-velocity - this is what causes the disk to not be perfectly flat.
        </p>
        <p>Notice that the star in the middle has a small and constant kinetic energy; while it is ultra-massive, it's
            also barely moving and thus has almost no KE. Then, the outer-most planets have the next smallest KE, which
            makes sense because they moe the slowest (as described by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Second_law">Kepler's second
                law</a>). As we look at particles closer to the host star, we see increasing kinetic energies (which is
            proportional to the square of a body's velocity).</p>
        <p>I should mention that in this first simulation, the mass of the planets is around one ten-billionth that of
            the host star, so the star's gravity is completely dominating the system. At a mass ratio of above around
            one millionth, we see the planets' gravity begin to have more noticeable effects, as shown in the second
            video below.</p>
        <video src="media/PlanetesimalDisk_2021-11-13-02-01-07.mp4" loop autoplay controls></video>
        <p>The exact same initial conditions <em>except</em> that planets are now only one one-thousandth the mass of
            the host star (this is ten million times more massive as in the video above). Notice how much more chaotic
            this system is - plants are swapping places left and right and a few even get ejected from the system
            entirely!</p>
        <video src="media/PlanetesimalDisk_2021-11-13-03-12-00.mp4" loop autoplay controls></video>
        <p>Finally, let's see what happens when we increase that z-velocity by a factor of ten from the previous two
            simulations.</p>
        <video src="media/PlanetesimalDisk_2021-11-13-03-21-09.mp4" loop autoplay controls></video>
        <p>Perhaps intuitively, all of the planets start with a higher KE than before (because they have a significantly
            higher initial velocity!). We see two planets migrate outwards and slow down as they are tugged on by the
            gravity of the host star. The others seem to continue doing their thing as time goes on. Amazing!</p>
