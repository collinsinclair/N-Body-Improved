    <h1>N-Body Simulation</h1>
    <p>Imagine a whole bunch of stuff (preferably coalesced into bodies like stars or planets) out there in space. Anywhere, anytime. Just, <em>imagine</em>. What are those things doing? Are they still? Spinning? Moving towards or away from one another? If only we could look at it for ourselves... But wait, <strong>we can!</strong> - and this tool (or toy?) can help.</p>
    <p>This <em>N-Body Simulation</em> started its life as my final project for CU Boulder's ASTR 2600: Introduction to Scientific Programming, but back then I didn't know what I was doing or how to do it, at least as far as useful programs go. So I decided to give that old IPython notebook a facelift and turn it into something others could experience and (hopefully) learn from.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Ugh. If any part of this program will stop people from enjoying it, it's the installation. Hopefully <a href="https://github.com/collinsinclair/N-Body-Improved/issues/16">someday in the future,</a> this will exist as an app instead of a series of scripts and modules that exist separately. For now, provided you have access to a Unix-like command line, you can run <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>. You'll also have to <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">install ffmpeg,</a> a multimedia framework.</p>
    <p>Once you have everything installed, you can <em>finally</em> run the program with <code>python3 main.py</code>. This will start the command line interface (or CLI, once you get to know it better).</p>

    <h2>Use</h2>
    You will first be greeted by some text introducing you to the program.
