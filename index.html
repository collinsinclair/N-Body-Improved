    <h1>N-Body Simulation</h1>
    <p>Imagine a whole bunch of stuff (preferably coalesced into bodies like stars or planets) out there in space. Anywhere, anytime. Just, <em>imagine</em>. What are those things doing? Are they still? Spinning? Moving towards or away from one another? If only we could look at it for ourselves... But wait, <strong>we can!</strong> - and this tool (or toy?) can help.</p>
    <p>This <em>N-Body Simulation</em> started its life as my final project for CU Boulder's ASTR 2600: Introduction to Scientific Programming.</p>
